# .gitignore for SysAdmin-Toolkit
# --- General Purpose ---

# Purpose: Ignore files generated by operating systems, editors, IDEs,
# temporary script outputs, and potentially sensitive configuration files.
#
# Note on IDE/Editor files: While it's best practice for collaborators to manage
# their specific editor settings in their global gitignore [5], common ones are
# included here for convenience. Add others to your global gitignore:
# `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global` [4]

# --- Operating System Generated Files ---
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db
Desktop.ini

# --- Editor/IDE Files & Directories ---
# VS Code
.vscode/
# JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.)
.idea/
# Sublime Text
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace
# Vim swap files and backups
*.swp
*.swo
*~
# Emacs backup and auto-save files
.#*
*#

# --- Log & Temporary Files ---
*.log
*.tmp
*.temp
*.bak
*.backup

# --- Potential Script Outputs or Build Artifacts ---
# Add directories or file patterns here if your scripts generate
# specific output files/folders that shouldn't be committed.
# Example:
# output/
# results/
# *.out

# --- Sensitive Information ---
# Ignore environment variables files
.env
.env.*
!.env.example

# Ignore configuration files that might contain secrets
# (adjust patterns as needed for your specific use cases)
config.json
config.yaml
config.yml
credentials*
*.key
*.pem
secrets.*

# --- Specific Tooling (Unlikely for pure scripts, but examples) ---
# Example: Terraform state files (if used alongside scripts) [3]
# *.tfstate
# *.tfstate.backup
# .terraform/

# Example: Python cache
# __pycache__/
# *.py[cod]

# --- Miscellaneous ---
# Any other project-specific files that should not be tracked.
